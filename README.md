Crossword puzzles are a timeless tradition that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.
This simple game stretches the mind of any person wishing to test their knowledge.

In a traditional crossword puzzle there are two main components.

The first component is the empty grid squares in the top half of the the page.
These squares are meant to be filled in by the crossword puzzle solver as they solve the clues.

The second component is the clues on the bottom half of the page.
These clues are meant to assist the crossword solver in the filling out of the puzzle.

In my crossword assignment, I will be including these two components that are necessities in any crossword puzzle.

Additionally, I will add a feature that allows the solver to check if they have filled out the puzzle correctly.
